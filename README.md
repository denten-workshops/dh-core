In this workshop we will cover the foundations of critical computing practice
in the humanities. We'll begin with the basics of files and operating systems,
plain text and binary formats, plain text, markdown, and rudimentary text
analysis using native command line tools.

## Philosophy\*
<sup>* for {critical | minimal | empowered | humanities} computing, inspired by [Ken Thompson and Doug
McIlroy](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)</sup>

- No black boxes!
- Use few, small, simple, universal, and powerful tools that you can hack and
  understand.
- Wherever possible store data in human-readable text streams.
- Do it right. Doing it badly accumulates intellectual, technological, and
  ethical debt.
- If you have to do something more than ~~once~~ a hundred times,<sup>†</sup>
  automate.
- Divide big problems into small, modular components.
- Bootstrap and time well spent.<sup>‡</sup>
- Keep poking, get help, take notes, comment, annotate, share, remix, and train
  others.

<sub>† Because you need to understand what you are automating, well.</sub>  
<sub>‡ This means investing time into skills that scale with your
experience and lead to more advanced applications.</sub>
