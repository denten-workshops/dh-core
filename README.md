In this workshop we will cover the foundations of critical computing practice
in the humanities. We'll begin with the basics of files and operating systems,
plain text and binary formats, plain text, markdown, and rudimentary text
analysis using native command line tools.

## What to do to prepare?

- A [plain text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

- [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
- [Babun](http://babun.github.io/)(Windows only)
- Latex (BasicTeX for Mac, MiKTeX for Windows, TeX Live for Linux)

time aside to help each other get started.
